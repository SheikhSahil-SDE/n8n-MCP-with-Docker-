### Summary

In this video, Jeremy Morgan from Code Cloud explores three methods of securely managing secrets within Terraform. The first approach, labeled as "good," 
involves using variables and `.tfvars` files to store secrets. 
While this method is better than hardcoding secrets directly into configuration files, it still stores secrets in plaintext, posing certain risks. 
The second approach, labeled as "better," utilizes environment variables to manage secrets, 
eliminating the risk of accidental commits to version control systems. However, sharing secrets across teams remains challenging. The third and most 
secure method, labeled as "best," demonstrates the integration of HashiCorp Vault, a dedicated secrets management tool. 
This method provides centralized management, granular access control, automatic secret rotation, and robust audit logging capabilities. 
By the end of the video, viewers learn practical steps for implementing each method, along with essential 
security practices for managing Terraform state files and secrets effectively.

## Key Insights
**Variables and .tfvars Files**

This foundational approach involves creating a variables.tf file to define variables like MySQL username and password. These values are 
sourced from a .tfvars file, which is added to .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure.
While this method provides a structured way to manage secrets, it still stores them in plain text, posing a risk if the file is compromised. 
The key takeaway is that while this method is better than hardcoding secrets directly into configuration files, 
it requires careful handling to avoid vulnerabilities.

**Environment Variables**

Storing secrets in environment variables represents a significant improvement over .tfvars files. By leveraging environment variables, 
secrets are dynamically loaded into Terraform during execution, eliminating the risk of accidental commits to version control. 
This method ensures that sensitive data remains isolated to the current session, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. 
However, it still relies on manual setup and maintenance, which can introduce human error.

**HashiCorp Vault Integration**

The most advanced and secure method involves integrating HashiCorp Vault, a dedicated secrets management tool. Vault provides centralized 
storage for secrets, enabling fine-grained access control and automated secret rotation. 
During the demonstration, Jeremy showcases how to set up a Vault server in development mode, store secrets securely, and configure 
Terraform to fetch these secrets dynamically. This approach eliminates the need to store secrets in files or environment variables,
offering unparalleled security and scalability.

**Centralized Secrets Management**

HashiCorp Vault's integration with Terraform enables centralized management of secrets, a critical feature for teams working collaboratively. 
By centralizing secrets in a single location, organizations can enforce strict access controls, 
ensuring that only authorized personnel can retrieve sensitive data. This centralized approach also simplifies auditing and compliance efforts, 
as all interactions with secrets are logged and monitored.

**Audit Logging and Secret Rotation**

One of Vault's standout features is its ability to generate detailed audit logs, providing transparency into who accessed secrets and when. 
Additionally, Vault supports automated secret rotation, automatically updating credentials to minimize the risk of compromise. These features 
are particularly valuable for maintaining long-term security and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

**Least Privilege Access**

Implementing least privilege access principles is essential for securing secrets in Terraform. By granting users only the permissions necessary 
to perform their tasks, organizations reduce the attack surface and limit potential damage in the event of a breach.
This principle applies equally to both environment variables and HashiCorp Vault, where access to secrets should be strictly controlled.
