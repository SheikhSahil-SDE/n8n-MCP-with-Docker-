**Best Practices for Terraform Security**
To ensure the highest level of security, Jeremy recommends several best practices:<p>
Always encrypt Terraform state files to protect sensitive data.<p>
Use version control but never commit secrets to repositories.<p>
Regularly rotate secrets to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.<p>
Enable audit logging to monitor and track all interactions with secrets.<p>
These practices collectively form a robust framework for securing secrets in Terraform, helping organizations maintain compliance and protect sensitive information.<p>
